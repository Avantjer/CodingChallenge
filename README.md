# Coding Challenge

### This project contains my solutions to a couple coding challenges I was provided

**CodingExercise3.swift**      	 - Contains my solution to **Coding Exercise 3**  
**CodingExerciseBonus.swift**  - Contains my solution to the **Bonus Coding Exercise**  
**CodingChallengeTests.swift** - Contains the tests of "**Coding Exercise 3**" and "**Bonus Coding Exercise**"  

**<u>Coding Exercise 3:</u>**  
Given two strings, determine if they share a common substring.  
A substring may be as small as one character.

**Example 1:**  
String 1 = “art”  
String 2 = “ammo”  
Both strings share ‘a’, so return true

**Example 2:**  
String 1 = “be”  
String 2 = “cat”  
No characters are shared, so return false

**<u>Coding Exercise Bonus:</u>**  
Return the length of the longest substring shared by two strings.

**Example:**  
String 1 = “wonderful”  
String 2 = “fulsome”  
Both words share “ful”, so return 3
